# Product Requirements Document: Extended AI Functionality for LessCode Platform

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the extension of AI functionality in the LessCode no-code platform to provide users with a comprehensive AI assistant that can modify any node in a workflow and the graph structure itself. The current system only allows AI chat within individual node editors, but this enhancement will introduce a global workflow-level AI assistant accessible during visual workflow design.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing AI Functionality
- **Node-Level Chat**: Currently available only within individual node editors
- **Code Modification**: AI can modify the code of the currently open node
- **Context Awareness**: AI has access to current node code, application databases, and other nodes in the workflow
- **Tool Integration**: Uses `modify_node` tool to update node code

### Current Limitations
- AI chat is only accessible when editing a specific node
- No ability to modify workflow structure (add/remove nodes, connections)
- No global workflow-level AI assistance
- Limited to code modifications within individual nodes

## Product Vision

Transform LessCode into an AI-first no-code platform where users can design, build, and modify entire workflows through natural language interaction, while maintaining the visual drag-and-drop interface as the primary design method.

## Objectives

1. **Global AI Assistant**: Provide a persistent AI chat sidebar accessible during workflow design
2. **Workflow Structure Modification**: Enable AI to add, remove, and modify nodes and connections
3. **Multi-Node Operations**: Allow AI to modify multiple nodes simultaneously
4. **Enhanced Context Awareness**: Provide AI with comprehensive workflow and application context
5. **Seamless Integration**: Maintain existing visual workflow design experience

## Target Users

- **Primary**: No-code developers using LessCode for workflow creation
- **Secondary**: Technical users who want to accelerate workflow development
- **Tertiary**: Business users who need to describe workflows in natural language

## User Stories

### Core User Stories

- As a workflow designer, I want to access AI assistance at any time during workflow design, so that I can get help without opening individual node editors.

**US-2: Workflow Structure Modification**
- As a workflow designer, I want the AI to add new nodes to my workflow, so that I can quickly expand functionality without manual node creation.

**US-3: Multi-Node Operations**
- As a workflow designer, I want the AI to modify multiple nodes simultaneously, so that I can make coordinated changes across my workflow.

**US-4: Natural Language Workflow Description**
