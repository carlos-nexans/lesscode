### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `GlobalChatSidebar.tsx` and `GlobalChatSidebar.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npm test` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- The implementation follows the 4-phase approach outlined in the PRD: Foundation, Core Functionality, Enhancement, and Polish.
